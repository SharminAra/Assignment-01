# CS 700: Assignment 1
* In this assignment, there are four files: main.cpp, section1.cpp, section2.cpp and student.cpp. The main.cpp file serves as the main program where all the functions are called and coordinated. The section1.cpp and section2.cpp files likely contain the implementations of various functions used in the main program.


## Section - 1 (section1.cpp)
* **read_student_data()** - Reads each line of data in a text file.
* **output_each_student_details()** - Using the following table, output each student's name, average exam score, and letter grade in a structured format to a console display.
* **all_student_information()** - Writes all data to an output file, including each student's information (name, the number of exam scores, followed by all the exam scores), the average exam score, and the letter grade maintained in a well-organized manner.


## Section - 2 (section2.cpp)
* **store_student_score()** - The exam scores are saved in a two-dimensional array, where the row index corresponds to the student number and the column index corresponds to the exam number.
* **avg_score_each_exam()**-Calculates the average score for each exam.
* **calculate_display_grade()**-Uses the exam's average score to determine and present the student's grade for that particular exam. For example, if the student's score falls within a range of Â± 5 points from the average, assign a grade of C.
* **write_student_info()**-Create an output file that lists each student's name, their exam scores, and corresponding grades in a neat format.


## student.cpp
* This module, which could be a separate source code file or a component of a larger program, houses a collection of functions that are designed to be used in multiple sections or parts of a program. These sections are specified as "section1.cpp" and "section2.cpp" files.

## section1.h, section2.h and student.h
* Documentation is provided in this context to offer a clear and comprehensive understanding of the code, making it easier for readers to comprehend how the code functions and its underlying logic.
